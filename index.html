I had my first computer when I was 8 and since than I knew that i want to have career in this direction. I was always intrugued what can you do on the computer, so of course it was always broken because i put something on it by downloading something or cmd something wrong. In high school I studied Computer Hardware so I know how they work on the inside, but Software was always something that I was more leaning to. So i hope with the help of the bootcamp to go Big as they say.</p>
